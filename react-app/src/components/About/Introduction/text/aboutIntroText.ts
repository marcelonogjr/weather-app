  ### About This Site

  Hi!
  
  My name is Marcelo, I'm a web developer and engineering student from Brazil, and this is my _ultimate_ Weather App.
  It's main purpose is to serve as complete fully functional project to compose my personal portfolio. It also served
  as a personal challenge to improve and consolidate my skills with project management and as a full-stack web
  developer.

  I built this app using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as a main programming language. The backend
  is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and the frontend uses [React](https://reactjs.org/),
  [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main), using [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
  for styling and a few animations, and more complex animations being handled by [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/).
  The weather forecast information and weather map layer comes from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/),
  while [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) provides geocode and street map layer services.
  
  To help me handle the texts to write the following series of articles I used [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown),
  with the addition to the [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math) and [rehype-katex](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-katex)
  to write all the math formulas contained in them. The illustrations are all made by me and some images that are
  used as exemples comes from Mapbox and OpenWeatherMap - sometimes with the modifications made in the backend of this
  app (the details are inside the articles).
  
  The entire code for this project is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/marcelonogjr/weather-app), in
  there you can see exactly what I used and how I built everything you see here - and also what you don't see.

  ### About the Following Series of Articles

  Besides building a working weather app where the user can look for the weather forecast in most places on earth,
  I also decided to write about some uncommon problems that I faced when building the weather section, but I did it
  in a _very unconvencional_ way.
  
  You won't see ***any*** lines of code.
  
  All I wrote about was problem solving (algorithms, in it's purest form), but I did my best to explain everything
  in the simplest way I could so anybody, no matter their background, could understand the solution to specific
  problems I faced when developing this App. I also wrote about the necessary concepts that's required in order to
  understand the explanations, pointed to several links that allows you to go deeper on a subject and made custom
  illustrations to improve comprehension of the text.
  
  There's a little bit of math in there, but don't worry, they are only there to show you that it's possible
  to find a specific value using a formula and you shouldn't pay too much attention to them, unless you are a
  developer trying to implement this solution in your own app or just curious about math.
  
  The articles are intended to be read in the original order - it will make more sense, but you can also understand
  them if you don't do that. They can also be considered a "heavy" reading if you decide to really learn everything,
  and in that case, I encourage you to read carefully to the articles and open the links contained in them to know
  more on a specific subject.
  
  The first one, the ***Map Coordinates Problem***, can take about 15 minutes to read - assuming that you'll stop and
  try to understand the illustrations as they show up. The ***Color Transformation Problem*** is a little bit longer,
  but shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to do the same. The last one, ***Dynamic Graph Color Problem***, is a little
  bit shorter, and you'll take about 7 minutes to read it. It seems like a lot, but I hope that you may find some
  interesting insights in there.

  If you have any questions or suggestions on how to improve the articles or this website in general, please send me
  and email at **marcelo@marcelojr.tech**.
  
  Without further ado, happy readings!
