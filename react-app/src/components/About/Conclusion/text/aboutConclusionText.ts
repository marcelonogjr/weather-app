  ## Conclusion

  I'm really thankful to you, reader, for getting this far through this madness and I hope that you are now able to
  take something useful to your life - even if it is what **not** to do when building a demo weather app ;D

  Jokes aside, I really think I've learned a lot writing this articles - that was _by far_ ***THE MOST*** difficult
  part of building this app. Programming is easy. Explaining what you did in a comprehensible way... That's *hard*.
  But it's also important to exercise that from time to time, because when you try to teach someone something you can
  actually evaluate how much you now about that subject. In fact, I'm not embarassed to say that I was able to catch
  some mistakes in my code when I started this proccess of writing, and I can honestly say that doing this really
  made me a better programmer.

  You could now be wondering, why write about those problems but never really write about their implementation?

  Well, I wanted to highlight some of the features that are not part of the _conventional_ weather app, but didn't
  want to make the explanation too specific so that someone would only understand what going on only if they
  understand TypeScript.
  
  If you are a developer, I wanted to bring you some content that are not specific to a particular programming
  language - the _Map Coordinates_ and the _Color Transformation_ problems are implemented on the backend of the app,
  and can be implemented using any language you like. If you are just a curious person that doesn't know anything
  about coding, you can also understand what's written there because I tried to approach the problems in a more
  universal way - that's the root of every engineering... Math, physics, programming languages are just tools to help
  implement the solutions. And perhaps that may inspire you to learn more about programming and open your mind
  to what can be achieved using simple intuitive logic.

  Obviously, I could write about other difficulties I had when bringing this app to life and even improve or
  implement more features to it. But a major part of engineering is project management, and everything that we do in
  life is also a choice of not doing other things, and the secret is really to spend our resources in the best way we
  can.

  Using this perspective, no work is ever finished, is it? We can aways improve... But is also important to move on
  and tackle other problems in order to evolve.

  Have a great day and as stated in the [introduction](https://weather.marcelojr.tech/about/intro) article, feel free
  to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions on how to improve this app.
